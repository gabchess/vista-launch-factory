# STRUCTURAL_INTEGRITY_ONLY — regenerates release-manifest.json and
# documentation-manifest.json file lists (sha256 + bytes). This script never
# publishes, never alters claim boundaries, and never touches content files.
#
# Inclusion policy (v0.2.0 — repo root IS the pack, ADR 0012):
#   - release-manifest.json: ALL shipped files under the repo root
#     (envelope + codex/ + claude/ ZIP + engine/ + barry/ + docs/ +
#     maintainer-source/ + voice-bank/ + this script), EXCLUDING:
#       * .git, .venv, .pytest_cache, __pycache__, .DS_Store
#       * runs/ and packages/ (run outputs, not pack surface)
#       * BOTH manifest files themselves (self-reference fix, 0.1.1 —
#         circular hashes cannot validate).
#     Dev-harness files at root (tests/, pytest.ini, requirements.txt,
#     run.sh, SHOW-ME.md, AGENTS.md) ARE included: the repo-link door
#     ships the whole working tree.
#   - documentation-manifest.json: documentation surface only — .md/.txt files
#     anywhere in the included tree, EXCLUDING .git, both manifest files,
#     engine/ internals other than engine/README.md and engine/adapters/*.md,
#     and dev-history docs (docs/2026-09-07-*.md are design/plan copies and
#     stay release-manifest-only). Non-doc files (json, zip, py, yaml,
#     .gitkeep) are not listed here.
#
# Run from anywhere:  python3 scripts/regen_manifests.py
