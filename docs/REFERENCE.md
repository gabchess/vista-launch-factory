# Engine reference

This is a from-source reference for operating the Launch Factory engine. Every
claim below was checked against the code in this checkout (`run.sh`,
`engine/scripts/*.py`, `engine/schemas/*.json`, and
the package under `packages/`). Where the code and the existing prose
docs (`README.md`, `docs/OPERATE-LAUNCH-FACTORY.md`) disagree, this file
follows the code and calls out the gap.

## 1. Commands

### `run.sh`: the one-command door

```
./run.sh RELEASE_FOLDER
```

No flags. `RELEASE_FOLDER` is a directory containing `release_campaign.json`
(directly, or the script falls back to `engine/fixtures/<folder-name>/`).
Runs five stages in order, `set -euo pipefail`, and stops at the first
failure. `fail()` prints the failed check plus a "safest re-entry" message to
stderr and exits 1. It does not retry.

| Stage | What runs | On failure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Creates `.venv/`, installs `requirements.txt` if needed | exits 1 |
| 1 | `init_release.py`, then `validate_record.py` on the fresh record | resumes if a record already exists at `runs/<name>/` |
| 2 | `validate_ledger.py` on the release folder's `claim_ledger.json` | skipped with a warning if no ledger file is found |
| 3 | `validate_campaign.py` on `release_campaign.json` | exits 1 on any missing slot or bad `reviewer.wip` |
| 4 | `build_package.py` into `packages/<campaign id>/` | exits 1 if an adapter path is missing |

The fixture previously verified here (the original client fixture) has been
removed from this checkout along with the client material it held. Before
relying on `./run.sh FIXTURE`, confirm your target fixture under
`engine/fixtures/` actually has every path `build_package.py` needs
(`cadence_binder.json`, `sources/*`, `claim_ledger.json`,
`engine/adapters/02_blog.md`, and `engine/honesty/still-needs-human.md`);
do not assume a fixture is complete just because it is present.

### `engine/scripts/*.py`: the six STRUCTURAL_INTEGRITY_ONLY scripts

All are plain `python3 script.py ...`. None call a network or publish
anything. Each prints JSON, except `init_release.py`, which prints the
record path. Each uses its exit code as the pass/fail signal.

| Script | Usage | Exit code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `init_release.py` | `RELEASE_FOLDER [--workspace DIR]` | 0, or a `SystemExit` message |
| `validate_record.py` | `RECORD` | 0 ok / 1 fail |
| `transition_slot.py` | `RECORD SLOT STATUS [--human-confirmed] [--reason TEXT]` | 0 ok / `SystemExit` on refusal |
| `validate_ledger.py` | `LEDGER_PATH` | 0 ok / 1 fail / 2 if kill-switch armed |
| `validate_campaign.py` | `CAMPAIGN_PATH` | 0 ok / 1 fail |
| `build_package.py` | `CAMPAIGN_JSON OUT_DIR [--work-root PATH]` | 0, prints the built path |

What each one does:

- **`init_release.py`**: sha256-hashes every file in `RELEASE_FOLDER`,
  writes `release-record.json` with all 7 slots defaulted to `held` (slots
  1/5/6 get a fixed ADR-0013 hold reason), and refuses to overwrite an
  existing record.
- **`validate_record.py`**: schema-checks the record, then confirms no slot
  is `approved`/`packaged` without a matching Reviewer `gates` entry, and that
  a `locked_by_reviewer` claims lock has its own timestamp and gate entry.
  Read-only.
- **`transition_slot.py`**: applies one permitted state transition to one
  slot and rewrites `RECORD` in place; see §3. `SLOT` accepts `1`-`7` or a
  slot name.
- **`validate_ledger.py`**: schema-checks the ledger, then confirms every
  `allowed` claim has a valid evidence span, no `allowed` text contains
  forbidden text, and every evidence `claim_id` resolves. Any failure arms
  `kill_switch.armed` and exits 2.
- **`validate_campaign.py`**: schema-checks the campaign, then confirms all
  7 slots exist with a `path` or `hold_reason`, all 7 artifact types are
  present, `reviewer.wip == 1`, and both segment lists are non-empty. Also
  exposes `validate_cadence_binder()`, unused by `run.sh`.
- **`build_package.py`**: builds `OUT_DIR/<campaign id>/` with one directory
  per slot, `cadence/` and `provenance/` copies, an `honesty/` stub,
  `MANIFEST.json` (`auto_publish: false` always), and a generated `REVIEWER.md`
  card. This shape matches neither package checked into `packages/` today;
  see §2.

### `engine/scripts/specialist_route.py`: offline specialist routing

```
python engine/scripts/specialist_route.py {route|validate-result|check-binding} REQUEST.json --workspace DIR [--result RESULT.json]
```

Not called by `run.sh`. Resolves specialist role(s) for a
`deliverable`/`stage` against `engine/specialists/registry.json`, re-hashes
every referenced file, and returns `status: held` with named reasons, or
`status: ready_for_protocol`. `human_approval_granted`,
`generation_authorized`, and `authentication_verified` are `false` in every
code path. Any error prints `{"status": "refused", ...}` and exits 2.

### Package-embedded scripts (not general engine commands)

`packages/camp_tix_launch_001/01_channel_run/serve_review.py --port PORT
[--film PATH] [--animation PATH]` and `verify_package.py [--write-manifest]`
are copied into that one package, hardcode paths relative to it, and are not
reusable across campaigns. The server range-serves two named videos only
after a sha256 check against `review-data.json`'s `approved` entries.

## 2. Package layout (ground truth: `packages/`)

One package is checked in today: `packages/camp_tix_launch_001/`. It does not
match the `build_package.py` shape described in §1.

A second example package once shipped here, shaped as
`artifacts/{blog,emails,changelog,social,login,popup}/` plus `campaign/`,
`claims/`, `costs/`, `events/`, `jobs/`, `reviews/`, `requests/`, `sources/`,
and `voice/`. It was removed along with the client material it held, and the
bespoke scripts that built it went with it, because they fetched that client's
pages live. To produce an equivalent example, run `./run.sh` against your own
release folder.

**`packages/camp_tix_launch_001/`** uses an unrelated, older two-stage
layout: `00_baseline/` (source manifest, claim-ledger.json, voice profile,
`approvals.json`), then `01_channel_run/` (per-channel dirs `blog/`,
`email/`, `changelog/`, `popup/`, `campaign/calendar.{json,csv}`, plus
`bindings/`, `requests/`, `routing/`, `verification/`,
`PACKAGE-MANIFEST.json`, `review.html`, and the §1 package-embedded
scripts). No script here builds this shape; treat it as hand-assembled, not
`build_package.py` output.

## 3. State machine (`engine/scripts/transition_slot.py`)

One `release-record.json` holds 7 slots (`1`-`7`, fixed names
`social_video, blog, email_segments, changelog, login_animation,
in_app_popup, campaign_plan`). Each slot's `state` is one of `held, drafted,
reviewed, approved, packaged`.

| From | To | Extra requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `held` | `drafted` | none, clears `hold_reason` |
| `drafted` | `reviewed` | none |
| `drafted` | `held` | `--reason TEXT` |
| `reviewed` | `approved` | `--human-confirmed` |
| `reviewed` | `held` | `--reason TEXT` |
| `reviewed` | `drafted` | none (request changes) |
| `approved` | `packaged` | `--human-confirmed` |
| `approved` | `reviewed` | none (request changes after approve) |

Every other `(from, to)` pair, including any transition into `held` without
`--reason`, is refused: the script raises `SystemExit("refused: ...")`,
printed to stderr, exit 1, and nothing is written to disk. A transition into
`approved`/`packaged` without `--human-confirmed` refuses the same way; only
Reviewer, the human, authorizes those two states, and the writer seat never
self-approves.

On success the script always appends one `run_log` entry, and, only for
transitions into `approved`/`packaged`, one `gates` entry
(`decided_by: "reviewer"`, `decision: "approve"`). This gate entry is what
`validate_record.py` later checks for, and it is written by the CLI flag
alone, not by any identity check (see §5).

`claims_lock.state` (`drafted` to `locked_by_reviewer`) is a separate record
field that no script in `engine/scripts/` transitions. `validate_record.py`
only checks that, once already `locked_by_reviewer`, a matching `locked_at`
timestamp and `gates` entry (`gate: "claims_lock"`) both exist.

## 4. Data files

**`claim_ledger.schema.json`** requires `campaign_id, allowed, forbidden,
needs_disclaimer, evidence, kill_switch`. Each `evidence` row's `source`
field is a closed enum: `loom_transcript | github_outline | footage_index`.
Redacted shape:

```json
{
  "campaign_id": "camp_...",
  "allowed": [{ "claim_id": "vw1", "text": "..." }],
  "forbidden": [{ "claim_id": "f1", "text": "...", "reason": "..." }],
  "needs_disclaimer": [{ "claim_id": "d1", "text": "...", "disclaimer": "..." }],
  "evidence": [{ "claim_id": "vw1", "source": "loom_transcript",
                 "path": "sources/...", "span_start": 498, "span_end": 550,
                 "quote": "..." }],
  "kill_switch": { "armed": false, "reason": null }
}
```

A fixture that previously shipped here (the original client fixture)
conformed to this schema, while the fuller example package's ledger did not:
its `evidence[].source` values (`supplied_email_source_text`,
`repository_source_text`, `public_web_capture`) were not in the schema enum,
so `validate_ledger.py` would fail against that file. Both were removed from
this checkout with the client material they held; check any fixture you add
against the schema's closed `evidence[].source` enum before assuming
`validate_ledger.py` will pass.

**`release-record.schema.json`** (`release-record/v1`): a record has
`record_id, release_folder{path,files[]}, ingest{state,at},
claims{allowed,forbidden,held}, claims_lock{state,locked_at}, slots[7],
voice_check, validations[], gates[], package_path, run_log[]`. Each slot is
`{slot,name,state,hold_reason}`; each gate is
`{gate,decision,decided_by,at}` with `decided_by` one of `reviewer | writer |
orchestrator`.

**`release_campaign.schema.json`**: `id, title, folder_id, status` (13-value
enum), `sources{loom,transcript,github_outline,footage[]}, claim_ledger_ref,
voice_pack_ref, segments{leads,customers,affiliate_rules}, artifacts[7],
cadence_ref, reviewer{seat,surface,wip}, hubspot_sandbox{draft_ids,status}`
(the field is literally named `hubspot_sandbox` in the schema regardless of
which CRM or ESP you actually use), `still_needs_human[]`. Each artifact is
`{slot,type,version,path,validation,reviewer_status,held,hold_reason}`.

**`cadence_binder.schema.json`**: `campaign_id, fixture_label, cells[]`,
each cell `{order,channel,artifact_slot,utm{utm_source,utm_medium,
utm_campaign},notes}`. `channel` is one of 8 fixed cadence values
(`changelog, email_interrupt, story_video, linkedin_written, x_written,
threads_written, instagram_video, tiktok_video`).

**`campaign/calendar.csv`** columns: `week, proposed_day, order, timezone,
channel, audience, asset_id, asset_path, action, review_state`. Illustrative
row, from a package removed with the client material it held:

```
1,Mon (proposed),1,America/Sao_Paulo,blog,all social managers,blog-v1,artifacts/blog.html,read linked-task story,delegated_review_pending_reviewer
```

`campaign/calendar.json` wraps the same rows, plus `scheduled: false`, a
`timezone`, and an `asset_index` mapping every `asset_id` to its file path.

**`costs/costs.json`**, redacted real example:

```json
{
  "currency": "USD",
  "incremental_paid_calls_this_run": 0,
  "observed_usd_this_run": 0,
  "prior_observed_usd": 0.235,
  "prior_provider_credit_usd_unknown": true,
  "ceiling_usd": 500
}
```

**`jobs/jobs.json`** shape: `{"jobs": [{"id","state","provider","paid"}]}`.
In the removed example package, every recorded job had `"state": "completed"`
and `"paid": false`.

**`events/events.jsonl`**: one JSON object per line, illustrative example
`{"event": "local_package_built", "at": "...", "paid_provider_call": false,
"route": "..."}`.

## 5. What is NOT implemented

The existing prose docs make several claims the code does not back up.
Verified against the actual scripts in this checkout:

- **No retries.** `run.sh`'s `fail()` exits on the first failure; no script
  under `engine/scripts/` loops or retries. The schemas carry a `retries`
  counter and a `retryable_fail` enum value, but nothing increments or acts
  on them yet.
- **No hash-bound approval invalidation.** `transition_slot.py` never reads
  or compares a file hash on approval. Nothing here reopens a gate when an
  approved file's content changes. The narrow exception is the video
  production validator, which binds its own approval to content bytes.
- **No auto-publish.** True as claimed: `build_package.py` hardcodes
  `"auto_publish": false` always, and nothing under `engine/` calls a send,
  publish, or schedule API.
- **No hosted trigger.** Every entrypoint here is a local CLI script, run
  from a shell or an agent session; no server, webhook, or UI starts a run.
- **No authentication on `--human-confirmed`.** It is a boolean CLI flag,
  not an identity check; anyone who can run the script can pass it.
  `specialist_route.py` says as much about itself, marking every output
  `"authentication_verified": false`.
